For my two baseline sources I chose all the compiled works of Shakespeare and the first 6 novels of the Harry Potter series by JK Rowling. I only chose the first 6 because I left out the last one for testing and to use as one of the four in the latter part. On top of The Deathly Hallows, I chose my WR120 op-ed, The Silmarillion written by JRR Tolkien, and the King James version of the Bible. These were the other works I chose because I wanted to compare something that I wrote, my favorite author, and one of the most important texts in human history. 

From my model, my own writing more likely came from Rowling, Tolkien more likely came from Shakespeare, The Deathly Hallows more likely came from Rowling, and The Bible more likely came from Shakespeare. My program worked well because all the results made sense. It would make sense that my writing was more similar to Rowling because we both wrote contemporary works. Tolkien and The Bible were more similar to Shakespeare because they are all older pieces of writing with old English phrases. And of course The Deathly Hallows was more similar to Rowling.
